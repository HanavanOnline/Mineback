# Mineback
Mineback is a service that enables Minecraft server owners to track data about their server(s) and view it elsewhere (their website, Xenforo, other plugins) in nice and useful formats. 

This project featured on GitHub is representative of the public-facing Bukkit/Spigot plugin used on Minecraft servers to transact data. 

Mineback uses a number of third-party software that give it further abilities, without compromising on performance. These third-party software solutions include:
